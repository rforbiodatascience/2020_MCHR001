## Description

Adding content to Github using git (exercise) using BLOSUM62 data for
PCA analysis, using project directory and project script files. Six
project script files are constructed:

01\_load.R (loading data), 02\_clean.R (for cleaning data - but just
passing data on in this setup), 03\_augment.R (for augmenting data -but
just passing data on in this setup), 04.analysis\_i.R (data analysis -
selecting, augmenting, modelling and visualising data in this setup),
99\_project\_functions.R(for function in more than one line of code -
not used en this setup), 00.doit.R (running all project scripts),

Final result dataframe is shown in results as are final scree and PCA
plot

According to Wikipedia: “In bioinformatics, the BLOSUM (BLOcks
SUbstitution Matrix) matrix is a substitution matrix used for sequence
alignment of proteins. BLOSUM matrices are used to score alignments
between evolutionarily divergent protein sequences.”
